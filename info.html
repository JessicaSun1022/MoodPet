    <p id="overview">
        In Mood Pet, you take on the role of a devoted caretaker for a charming little companion. Every moment counts:
        your pet has five core needs—Hunger,
        Fun, Hygiene, Potty, and Overall Happiness—that gradually slip away over time. You satisfy these needs by
        selecting the right items and completing
        mini-tasks—like feeding an apple, tossing a ball, or scrubbing away dirt—and watching your pet’s stats climb
        back toward full. Be careful, though:
        if your pet’s Overall Happiness drops to zero, your journey together comes to a tragic end.
