            Welcome to Mood Pet!

        <p id = "overview">
            In Mood Pet, you take on the role of a devoted caretaker for a charming little companion. Every moment counts: your pet has five core needs—Hunger, 
            Fun, Hygiene, Potty, and Overall Happiness—that gradually slip away over time. You satisfy these needs by selecting the right items and completing 
            mini-tasks—like feeding an apple, tossing a ball, or scrubbing away dirt—and watching your pet’s stats climb back toward full. Be careful, though: 
            if your pet’s Overall Happiness drops to zero, your journey together comes to a tragic end.
